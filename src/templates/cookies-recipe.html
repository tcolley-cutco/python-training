    <h3>Recipe for Chocolate Chip Cookies </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Start by browning 2 sticks of unsalted butter.
            Once brown, place in a measuring cup and refrigerate for 1 hour or until it’s re-solidified.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the butter along with ½ cup of white sugar and 1 ½ cups of brown sugar.
            Mix well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next add 2 cold eggs to the mixture, and mix to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a separate medium bowl, whisk together 11 ½ ounces of all purpose flour,
            1 Tbsp of kosher salt, ½ tsp of baking soda, and ¾ tsp of cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add half of dry ingredients to the stand mixer, mix to combine, and then add the other half of the dry ingredients.
            This helps keep your gluten down.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add your chocolate chips, stir just until everything is well combined and remove dough from mixer.
            Place in a bowl and refrigerate for at least an hour or as long as 2 days.
        </li>
        <li>
            Optional: You can toast some nuts and add those to your cookie dough as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll your cookie dough into balls and then break in half and set on cookie sheet.
            This will help give the cookies a rustic look.
            Bake in a 350°F oven for 12-17 minutes or until they’ve reached your preferred doneness.
            Top with a little bit of sea salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let cool for a few minutes, serve and enjoy.
        </li>


    </ol>
