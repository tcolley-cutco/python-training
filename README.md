# python-training

This repo houses a test flask application that was made to demonstrate how to use Flask on an IBMi mid-range. The application uses Bootstrap in places and is largely for testing purposes, however it does have working authentication in places. It also houses other applications developed during the Python training, although their production usability is up for debate in some cases.
